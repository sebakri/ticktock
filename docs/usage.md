# Usage

TickTock is designed to stay out of your way while keeping you productive.

## Managing Tasks

*   **New Task**: Click "New Task" or press `⌘ + N`.
*   **Start Tracking**: Click the play icon next to a task or use the assigned shortcut (e.g., `⌘ + 1`).
*   **Adding Labels**: Use the `#` symbol in the task description or tags field to categorize tasks.

## Menu Bar (Top Bar)

TickTock lives in your menu bar. Clicking the icon opens the app or brings it to the foreground. Use the context menu (right-click) to toggle whether the current task name is displayed directly in the menu bar.

## Filtering

You can select multiple labels simultaneously to refine your activity list. Clicking "All" resets all active filters.
