# Data & Privacy

TickTock is built with a local-first philosophy: your data stays on your device unless you explicitly choose to export or sync it.

## Local Storage

All tracking data is stored in a local SQLite database in the application data folder. We do not transmit your activity or task details to external servers by default.

## Exporting and Backups

You can export your data from the app to create backups or move data between machines. Exported files are plain files that you control.

## Privacy-Minded Design

- No analytics are collected unless you opt in.
- Sensitive fields are kept private and are not shared.

If you have questions about privacy or data handling, open an issue on the GitHub repository.
